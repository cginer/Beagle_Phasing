# Beagle_Phasing

To phase an inversion you should clone the directory anywhere in GCF's server

```
git clone https://github.com/cginer/Beagle_Phasing.git
```

Run the script by typing

```
cd Beagle_Phasing/Beagle_3.3.2/
bash PHASING.sh -i "HsInv0001"
```

You will find the phased inversions for each population in the directory `HsInv0001/VCFhap/POPULATION/`.
